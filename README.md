# Kotlin Template

This basic template for working in a Kotlin project includes:

1. Version configuration for Kotlin 1.9 and JVM 17
2. Tests setup
3. GHA Pipeline with Spotless and Tests
4. Catalog Versions (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)

In order to use just replace the pkg name and config the name of the pkg in `settings.gradle.kts`
